# Self-Learning-Computer-Science :collision:

Welcome ðŸ‘‹! This contains the courses I have used to learn computer science. The links below will take you either to another repository which contains my solutions for homeworks/labs/projects or to the course website where you can see the full schedule etc.

Computer Science is incredibily interesting and these courses are extremely interesting.

If you find this repo useful :star2: it! Its great to know other people are coming to visit.
